# Fuel Go

### Gas Station Finder & Review App

Fuel Go is an app designed to help users find nearby gas stations based on their location, displaying results in both map and list formats. This project was a collaborative effort with a friend from school. You can find the original project repository [here](https://github.com/harinder24/FuelGo).

## Motivation

This app was my graduation project, developed in collaboration with a friend. We wanted to create a map-based application, and we decided on a gas station finder since gas stations are commonly searched for. The project provided an opportunity to work with real-time location data and create an app that could offer both functionality and convenience to users.

## Focus Areas

During the development of Fuel Go, we focused on the following key aspects:
- Building a **responsive web design** to ensure the app works well on various devices.
- Creating a **user-friendly interface** for a smooth and intuitive user experience.
- Ensuring the app was **error-free** by thoroughly testing and troubleshooting during development.

## Contributions

### My Contributions
- Created the **Figma design** for the app's UI. [View the Figma Design]([FIGMA_LINK](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1425250046832718731/fuel-go))
- Structured and improved the **frontend code**.
- Connected the **frontend** to the **backend APIs** and performed testing.
- Debugged issues related to frontend-backend integration and communicated them to my teammate for fixes.
- Contributed to additional frontend code for features as needed.

### Collaborator's Contributions
- Developed the **frontend** based on the Figma design.
- Implemented the **backend APIs** and integrated them with the frontend.
- Handled the **gas station detail page** integration between frontend and backend.
- Contributed to additional frontend code for features as needed.
